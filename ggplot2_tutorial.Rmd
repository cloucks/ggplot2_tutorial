-ggplot2 is based on a grammar that is composed of a set of independent components that can be put together in many different ways

-It functions using layers where you start with the raw data then add on annotations and statistical summaries

-Today we will be working with data from my research looking at how worms with different genetic defects habituate to mechanical stimuli


```{r-load_data}

#load and take a look at data
setwd("~/Documents/PhD/Programming_study_group/ggplot2_tutorial")
habituation <- read.table("data.txt", header=TRUE)
head(habituation)

```

```{r-make_plot}

#make sure ggplot2 is installed
if(!require("ggplot2")) {
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    library(ggplot2)
  }

#plot time on x-axis and reversal on y-axis
qplot(x=time, y=reversal, data=habituation)


#look at habituation data
head(habituation)

#can also plot manipulations of data directly in ggplot2
qplot(x=time, y=reversal/N, data=habituation)

```

```{r-adding_aesthetics}
#adding aesthetics (e.g. colour, size and shape)
qplot(x=time, y=reversal/N, data=habituation, colour=strain)
qplot(x=time, y=reversal/N, data=habituation, shape=strain)
qplot(x=time, y=reversal/N, data=habituation, colour=tap_number)





```
  
  
  

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
