 - **Authors**: Catrina Loucks
 - **Research field**: Genetics
 - **Lesson Topic**: In this lesson we will be using ggplot2 to create plots that are beautiful, flexible and reproducible

###Motivation
- In general, R helps to streamline data analysis, so that you can use it to both analyze your data and create beautiful graphs at the push of a button 
- Consequently, plots become easy to make and are highly reproducible if you want to run similar experiments again
- ggplot2 is also incredibly flexible allowing you to build your graphs exactly how you want them

####First make sure you have ggplot2 

```{r-get_ggplot2}

#Make sure ggplot2 is installed
if(!require("ggplot2")) {
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    library(ggplot2)
  } 
```

 - In my research I am interested in how worms with different genetic defects respond to sensory stimuli
 - Today we will be working with data from my research looking at how different worm mutants respond to repeated mechanical stimuli (taps)
 - Worms reverse when subjected to a tap, but will learn to ignore taps and reverse less

####Then load the data

 
```{r-load_data}
#load and take a look at data
#set working directory to folder containing the data.txt file for this tutorial
setwd("~/Documents/PhD/Programming_study_group/ggplot2_tutorial")
data <- read.table("data_short.txt", header=TRUE)
data

#These data compare a mutant strain to wild-type animals (normal worms, here named N2) 
#Each strain is subjected to repeated taps (30 in total) and reversals are recorded at each tap
#All worms are expected to respond similarly to the first tap (most reversing), but some mutants learn faster or slower to ignore the tap stimuli
```

####Now make a plot with tap_number on the x-axis and reversal on the y-axis
- ggplot starts with two arguments: data and aesthetic mapping
 
```{r-make_plot}
#Assign plot to object p 
p <- ggplot(data, aes(tap_number, reversal)) #aes is short for aesthetic mapping
```

####You need to add layers to display graph
 - A layer can be as simple as specifying a geom 
 - Geom is short for geometric object and describes the type of object that is used to display the data 
 
```{r-add_layers}
#you can add layers to the plot with a +
p + geom_point() #geom_point is added to make data a scatterplot
```

####You can also manipulate data directly in ggplot2
 - All strains should respond similarly to the first tap, but we see that the two strains start at different points on the y-axis
```{r-manipulate_data}
#Look at habituation data
data

#We have a column with reversal, which represents the number of worms reversing, and a column with N, which represents the total number of worms looked at during the tap
#To look at the proportion of worms reversing, we need to divide reversal by N
#This can be done directly in ggplot2

p <- ggplot(data, aes(tap_number, reversal/N)) + #Manipulate the y-axis to become reversal/N
  geom_point()
p

#Now both strains show a similar response to the intial tap
```

####Now we can play with aesthetics 
 - Aesthetics are visual properties affecting the way observations are displayed (e.g. colour, size and shape)

```{r-adding_aesthetics}
#You can assign categorial variables a colour or shape and continuous variables to size

p  + geom_point(aes(colour=strain)) #Use aesthetics to colour points in scatterplot according to strain

p + geom_point(aes(shape=strain)) #Different shapes represent the different strains

p + geom_point(aes(colour=tap_number, shape=strain)) #Can string two aesthetics together using commas

p + geom_point(aes(colour=tap_number, shape=strain, size=7)) #Can also play around with size
```
  
  
####You can also experiment with geoms to get different kinds of plots 
- (e.g. scatterplot=geom_point(), line plot = geom_line(), and boxplot=geom_boxplot())
```{r-varying_geom}
p + geom_point(aes(colour=strain))

p + geom_point(aes(colour=strain)) + #Can add other layers with the +
  geom_line() #Make graph a line plot

p + geom_point(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_line(aes(group=strain)) #Add group in aesthetics to make lines attach points from the same strain

p + geom_point(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour=strain)) #Changing group to colour in aesthetics to make the lines the same colour as the points
```


##Challenge 1

Make a boxplot of strain on x-axis (categorical variable) and N (number of animals assessed) on y-axis to determine how many animals were tested

 - hint: use geom_boxplot()


####You can also add error bars to the graph
```{r-error_bars}
p + geom_point(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=conf_int_lower, ymax=conf_int_upper, colour=strain))
```

####Next, we can make labels (title, axes and legend)
```{r-making_labels}
p + geom_point(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=conf_int_lower, ymax=conf_int_upper, colour=strain)) +
  ggtitle("Habituation probability") + #Add title
  xlab("Tap number") + #Add x-label
  ylab("Proportion reversing") + #Add y-label
  scale_colour_hue("type of worm", #Change legend title
    breaks = c("mutant", "N2"), #Determine what strains are on the legend
    labels = c("mutant", "wild-type")) #Determine the names of the legend strains
```

####We can also decide what values we want on our axes
```{r-changing_axes}
p + geom_point(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=conf_int_lower, ymax=conf_int_upper, colour=strain)) +
  ggtitle("Habituation probability") + #Add title
  xlab("Tap number") + #Add x-label
  ylab("Proportion reversing") + #Add y-label
  scale_colour_hue("type of worm", #Change legend title
    breaks = c("mutant", "N2"), #Determine what strains are on the legend
    labels = c("mutant", "wild-type")) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,31), breaks=c(0,5,10,15,20,25,30)) + #Change limits and spacing in x-axis
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0.0,1.0), breaks=c(0.0,0.20,0.40,0.60,0.8,1.0)) #Change limits and spacing in y-axis
```

##Challenge 2

Make a plot with tap_number on the y-axis and proportion reversing on the y-axis that only displays the last 10 taps

 - hint: change limits of axis


####Finally we can play around with the style of the graph
```{r-change_style}
p + geom_point(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=conf_int_lower, ymax=conf_int_upper, colour=strain)) +
  ggtitle("Habituation probability") + #Add title
  xlab("Tap number") + #Add x-label
  ylab("Proportion reversing") + #Add y-label
  scale_colour_hue("type of worm", #Change legend title
    breaks = c("mutant", "N2"), #Determine what strains are on the legend
    labels = c("mutant", "wild-type")) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,31), breaks=c(0,5,10,15,20,25,30)) + #Change limits and spacing in x-axis
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0.0,1.0), breaks=c(0.0,0.20,0.40,0.60,0.8,1.0)) + #Change limits and spacing in y-axis 
  theme_classic() + #Gives a nice white background without gridlines
  theme(legend.title=element_blank()) #Removes legend title (can override the previous manipulation of the legend)
```
  
Save plot
```{r-save_plot}
p + geom_point(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=conf_int_lower, ymax=conf_int_upper, colour=strain)) +
  ggtitle("Habituation probability") + #Add title
  xlab("Tap number") + #Add x-label
  ylab("Proportion reversing") + #Add y-label
  scale_colour_hue("type of worm", #Change legend title
    breaks = c("mutant", "N2"), #Determine what strains are on the legend
    labels = c("mutant", "wild-type")) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,31), breaks=c(0,5,10,15,20,25,30)) + #Change limits and spacing in x-axis
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0.0,1.0), breaks=c(0.0,0.20,0.40,0.60,0.8,1.0)) + #Change limits and spacing in y-axis 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank()) #Removes legend title
#ggsave("final_plot.pdf", width=9, height=6)
```

###Answer to challenge 1
```{r-make_boxplot}
ggplot(data, aes(strain, N)) +
  geom_boxplot()

#you can also add a fill with geom_boxplot(fill="red")
```

###Answer to challenge 2
```{r-last_ten_taps}
p + geom_point(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=conf_int_lower, ymax=conf_int_upper, colour=strain)) +
  ggtitle("Habituation probability") + #Add title
  xlab("Tap number") + #Add x-label
  ylab("Proportion reversing") + #Add y-label
  scale_colour_hue("type of worm", #Change legend title
    breaks = c("mutant", "N2"), #Determine what strains are on the legend
    labels = c("mutant", "wild-type")) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(19,31), breaks=c(20,25,30)) + #Change limits and spacing in x-axis
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0.0,1.0), breaks=c(0.0,0.20,0.40,0.60,0.80,1.0)) #Change limits and spacing in y-axis
```

####Or you can subset the data ahead of time
```{r-test}
ggplot(subset(data, tap_number>=20)) +
  aes(tap_number, reversal/N) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour=strain)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=conf_int_lower, ymax=conf_int_upper, colour=strain)) +
  ggtitle("Habituation probability") + #Add title
  xlab("Tap number") + #Add x-label
  ylab("Proportion reversing") + #Add y-label
  scale_colour_hue("type of worm", #Change legend title
    breaks = c("mutant", "N2"), #Determine what strains are on the legend
    labels = c("mutant", "wild-type")) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(19,31), breaks=c(20,25,30)) + #Change limits and spacing in x-axis
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0.0,1.0), breaks=c(0.0,0.20,0.40,0.60,0.80,1.0)) #Change limits and spacing in y-axis
```
